    <h2>Our Virtues</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Clarity</h3>
        <h4>Simple and Intuitive</h4>
        <p>
          Every element is placed with purpose. We minimize clutter and use whitespace to guide the eye, ensuring users can focus on what matters most. Navigation menus are straightforward, and content is structured logically to reduce cognitive load.
        </p>
        <h4>Readable Typography</h4>
        <p>
          Fonts are chosen for legibility and comfort. Headings stand out, and body text is easy to scan and understand. We pay close attention to line height, font size, and contrast, making sure that every word is a pleasure to read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarity also means clear calls to action. Buttons are distinct, and links are descriptive, guiding users effortlessly through the site.
        </p>
        <button>Explore Clarity</button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Openness</h3>
        <h4>Welcoming Layouts</h4>
        <p>
          Our pages invite exploration, with open navigation and clear calls to action. We avoid barriers, making information accessible to all. Whether you’re browsing on a phone, tablet, or desktop, our layouts adapt to your needs.
        </p>
        <h4>Inclusive Design</h4>
        <p>
          Accessibility is a priority. We use high-contrast colors, descriptive links, and ensure our sites work for everyone. Our designs are tested with screen readers and keyboard navigation to guarantee universal usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Openness also means sharing knowledge. We publish guides, host Q&A sessions, and encourage members to contribute resources for the benefit of the whole community.
        </p>

        <h3>Energy</h3>
        <h4>Vibrant Visuals</h4>
        <p>
          Bright accents and uplifting imagery keep users engaged and motivated. We use color to create a positive, energetic atmosphere. Visual cues such as icons, highlights, and banners help direct attention and add personality to our designs.
        </p>
        <h4>Interactive Experiences</h4>
        <p>
          Subtle animations and responsive feedback make every interaction enjoyable and intuitive. Hover effects, transitions, and micro-interactions bring the interface to life without overwhelming the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Energy is about momentum. We encourage users to participate, share feedback, and become a part of the Light Side’s ongoing story.
