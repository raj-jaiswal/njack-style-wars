# 🌗 Style Wars: Light v.s Dark

Welcome to **Style Wars: Light v.s Dark**

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

> “The web is divided! Two great factions, the light side and the dark side, are at war. You must choose to join either faction and style plain HTML pages following either a light or dark color-theme. The faction with the best submissions wins!”

---

## 🎯 Objective

You will receive a set of unstyled HTML pages.  
Your task is to style these pages using **only CSS** (regular CSS and frameworks, both allowed) following the theme of the faction you choose:

- **Light Side:** Style a bright, uplifting web page.
- **Dark Side:** Style a dark, bold web page.

Your final web page should be **visually appealing** and **responsive** across all devices.

---

## 📜 Rules

- **Single-member participation**; one submission per member.
- Any CSS solution is allowed: regular CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.
- Your web page must be either:
  - **Light-themed:** Predominantly brighter base colors, or
  - **Dark-themed:** Predominantly darker base colors.
- **Do not modify the HTML structure.**  
  You may only add:
  - Links to your stylesheets, fonts, or framework CDNs
  - IDs and/or class names (add or alter as needed)
- **No paid libraries or frameworks.**  
  Only free tools are permitted.
